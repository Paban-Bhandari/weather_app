# Weather App
This is a simple Flutter app I built for my assignment. It shows the current weather for Kathmandu by default, and you can search for any city to see its weather.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Flutter installed.
2. Get a free API key from OpenWeatherMap and put it in `lib/main.dart`.
3. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies.
4. Run the app with `flutter run`.

## Features
- Shows weather for Kathmandu on startup
- Lets you search for any city
- Displays temperature, weather description, and an icon

## Note

I made this app to practice Flutter and working with APIs. If you have any questions, feel free to ask!

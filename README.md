# Weather App
This is a simple Flutter app I built for my assignment. It shows the current weather for Kathmandu by default, and you can search for any city to see its weather.

## Features
- Shows weather for Kathmandu on startup
- Lets you search for any city
- Displays temperature, weather description, humidity and wind speed
